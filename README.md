SynologyDownloadStationAdapter
==============================
This application allows you to add links by container (dlc, ccf, rsdf) and Click'N'Load to your Synology Download Station

Requirements
==============================
* .NET Framework 4.5
* Access to internet (Containers will be decrypted using http://dcrypt.it/)

Features
==============================
* Add links with Click'N'Load
* Add links using containers (dlc, ccf, rsdf)
* Add plain text links
* Associate with supported file types


Note
==============================
I'm not even sure whether the container formats ccf and rsdf are working or not. I wasn't able to find any example files. Maybe I'll remove the support for these containers completely in a furure release.
